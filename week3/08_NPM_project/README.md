Creating an NPM project to manage third party dependencies
Overview

Node.js Package Manager (NPM), is responsible for managing third party code we use in our project. The web is built on a foundation of open source code, and in the web development world NPM is the oldest and most widely used. The NPM registry maintains a huge collection of code packages that you can use in your projects, installed with a single command in your terminal. View the NPM site here.
Class Plan

    Demo: Demonstration of NPM, and real world examples of usage in web projects: package.json, package-lock.json, and node_modules (and .gitignore!)
    Workshop: Make your own NPM project, install a package, and use it in your code

Success Criteria

    I can explain in my own words what NPM is and why we use it.
    I can set up my app for NPM to be used by creating and configuring up a package.json file and a .gitignore file.
    I can install a package using NPM in the terminal.
    I can use NPM to interact with the package and my app.

Workshop
Starting a new NPM project

Something you’ll end up doing a lot when you’re doing JavaScript development is using NPM, installing packages, upgrading packages and running scripts.

⛳️ Open up your terminal, and create a new directory for a new project.

mkdir npm-project-setup
cd npm-project-setup

⛳️ Initialise a new NPM project in the directory.

npm init -y

👀 You’ll see the contents of a new package.json file printed to the screen. You can open that file in your code editor using code ..

💭 The package.json file is a manifest of our project, with information about third party libraries that are used, the type of project it is, and scripts that can be run to run and test our code. When looking at a Node.js project, you can often learn a lot about it (beyond a README file) by looking at the package.json file.
Installing a package

NPM provides millions(!) of packages, all of them can be installed with a single command.

npm install <package-name>

⛳️ We’re going to write some coloured log messages to the terminal, and to do it we’re going to use a popular JS package called chalk.

npm install chalk

👀 You’ll see a new directory called node_modules has been created, and inside it is a directory called chalk. This is the open source code that NPM installed for us. “node_modules” is a managed folder, where NPM projects store any third party code you use.

👀 You’ll also see a package-lock.json file. That’s keeping track of the files. It’s useful for predictable builds, but it can easily be recreated at any time by running npm install, so don’t worry too much if it causes git conflicts!
Using a package

Now we’ve installed chalk we should be able to use it in our code.

⛳️ Create a new file called index.js and add the following code:

const chalk = require("chalk");

console.log(chalk.blue("Hello world!"));

⛳️ Run the file with node index.js.

👀 You should see the message “Hello world!” printed in blue.
JS Modules

The above syntax is CommonJS Node.js import syntax. We can switch to using modern ES6 import syntax by adding a value to our package.json.

⛳️ Add a new key to the package.json file, under the title, called “type”, and set it to “module”.

"type": "module",

⛳️ Change the import syntax in the index.js file to use ES6 syntax.

import chalk from "chalk";

console.log(chalk.blue("Hello world!"));

⛳️ Run the file with node index.js.

👀 You should see the message “Hello world!” printed in blue again!

Modern projects will often use the latter approach, but there is plenty of code out there that still uses the former.
Adding a script to package.json

The package.json file has a “scripts” object. We can add commands that we commonly run here. A common convention for Node.js project is to add a “dev” script, to run the script in development mode.

⛳️ Add a new script to the package.json file, called “dev”, and set it to run the index.js file.

"scripts": {
  "dev": "node index.js"
},

⛳️ Run the script with npm run dev.

👀 You should see the message “Hello world!” printed in blue again!

💭 It doesn’t matter which you use, but we’ll tend to give examples using modern ES6 syntax going forward. That means we need to make sure we’ve got "type": "module" in our package.json!
Adding a .gitignore file

By default git tries to manage every file in the directory.

If we want it to ignore certain files to avoid committing them to git, we can add them to a .gitignore file. This is a plain text file that lets you list filenames that you’d like git to ignore.

⛳️ Create a new file called .gitignore and add the following contents:

node_modules

This will make sure we don’t commit the third party code we’re using to git.

🎯 Write some pretty log messages to the terminal using chalk. Read the Chalk documentation on NPM, or Github, or in the README.md. Have fun with it.
